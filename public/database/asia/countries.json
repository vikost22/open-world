In distant villages, fruits, rice, coffee, tea, cloves, black pepper, rubber are traditionally grown on colorful terraces... The cult of ancestors and hundreds of other secret religions and scientists still lived here. The mixture of Buddhism, Confucianism, polytheism, totemism makes each village and family unique.

From here we can see the highest ridge of the country - Hoang Liên Sơn (Vietnamese: Hoàng Liên Sơn - \"main mountain range\"). In the city, many cultures and ethnic groups mixed in an amazing way: H'Mong, Dao, Nung and Hoa. In the vicinity of Bac Ha, about 10 of them live -you! And they all gather on Sundays at a huge bazaar - a market where they sell handicrafts, food, livestock... We will visit this market, we will be able to choose unique souvenirs and see a variety of national costumes. The town is also famous for the production of traditional alcoholic beverages: rice wine , cassava and corn liquor. We will definitely taste it 😉",

Many beautiful rivers flow here, and fertile valleys delight with an abundance of strange flowers and fruits. Along the way, we will visit ethnic villages, and all the time we will be accompanied by beautiful landscapes. For the night, we will stay in Thai homestay. Our trip to Vietnam will allow not only to get acquainted with the beautiful nature and sights of the country, but also to get to know the different cultures of its inhabitants.",

Stormy rivers and streams cascade down waterfalls, raising a cloud of cool dust in the middle of the forest. In the evening, we arrive in the village of Che-La, where we spend the night with another hospitable host."
